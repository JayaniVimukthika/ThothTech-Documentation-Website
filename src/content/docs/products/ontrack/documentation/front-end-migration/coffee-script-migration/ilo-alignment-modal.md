It works through  popup window for Admin/ Convenor accounts, includes the adding rating and justification for given learning outcome of the task. The given ratig is displayed through a number (1-5). 

This modal has proper mechanism, but some of the changes can be proposed to enhance this.

So, in the proposed modal the user provides the following changes:

1.Progress bar should be alighned to center of the popup window
2.The assignment name and the learning outcome is displayed through bold letters, not in the colored boxes
3.The rational message should be displayed with proper alignment and font size.

New design sketch: Existing UI components are to be used for the input fields and button etc.
